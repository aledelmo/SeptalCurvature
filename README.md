# Septal Curvature Analysis

Analysis of the septal curvature from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images.

The septal curvature is calculated as the ratio of the septal and lateral wall curvatures. The curvature of the septal and
lateral walls in each frame was then calculated as the inverse of the circle circumscribed by the 3 points in the regions of interest.
Negative septal curvature denotes a leftward convexity of the septum (septum bowing into the left ventricle).
Septal curvature should be measured in the short-axis plane at the level of the left ventricular (LV) papillary muscles.

Project containing a [3DSlicer]() GUI for the Septal Curve calculation.
